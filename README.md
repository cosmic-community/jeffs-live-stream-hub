### Content Model Prompt

> "I want to create a twitch clone where I can have my webcam showing me in the top screen and another screen below where I can have my screen showing. On the side I want there to be a chat function that allows viewers to comment during the live stream. I want to be able to be able to login on the backend for me to have access to all of the tools (screen sharing, web cam, comments) and also a user facing side that has these three things neatly displayed. Do you know how to do this? "
